# RadioCast
bluetooth sink / Internet Radio receiver

inspired by : ( https://www.hackster.io/esikora/esp32-audio-project-part-i-internet-radio-with-i-s-dac-a5515c)

based on multicore esp32 (needed by audio lib)
32 bit DAC for output controlled through I2S
12x64 I2C Oled screen for display
2 buttons for control, click & doubleClick & long press

optional case? (cnc)

# Hardware

## microcrontroler: ESP32S3
pre-requisite: DualCore for performances, BT, Wifi

## Screen: SH1106 128X64 OLED
Communication Lib:
-  [olikraus/u8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2), potentially compatible with SSD1306
        * strange behaviour from compiler: not finding csrc et cppsrc in u8g2 => Include directive added to platformio.ini

*Image generation workflow:*
- scale down to YYxZZ
- saved as XMB
- append PROGMEM to declaration

### Hardware modification:
note that to get a functionning device you must solder the 2 pads close to SCK (or bring it to GND)
Those are circled in green in teh previous picture

On my board, i also had to solder 3 pads of the jack connecter (it was only soldered on one side)

# Implementation choices

## Updating screen

Time management in main loop:
> IF time elapsed since last display update > Frame period  
> THEN  
>     * memorize current time  
>     * increment frame count  
>     * call updateDisplay  

## Switching between features without rebooting

The original projet  couldn't manage to switch beetween Wifi&Bluetooth without crashing due to lack of IRAM.
Even though i properly desacllocated booth I2S/WIFI/BT on menu exit, the bluetooth still used an **UNSANE** amount of IRAM.
and if you free it (with .end(true)), you can't start it again.

if found these options:
>-D BOARD_HAS_PSRAM
>-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue
>-D CONFIG_BT_ALLOCATION_FROM_SPIRAM_FIRST=1
>-D CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_WORKAROUND=1
enabling the use of PSRAM (ram extension through SPI) but you need a special board/extension board

I used the original solution temporarely (through define option *MY_ESP32_LACKS_SRAM*) and ordered an ESP32WROVER wich got a buildin 4Mo PSRAM



# UI flow

2 functions: 
- Radio from internet
- A2DP bluetooth sink

use *Button 1* short press to pass from one to another.  
Bluetooth / wifi only activated in their respected mode  
  
1 auxiliary function: *Button 1* long press enter WIFI AP configuration mode. Allows to:
- input credential for the Wifi
- update firmware

## Radio

press *button 2* to cycle between Radio stations. Those are hardcoded
double click cycle back

## Bluetooth sink

press *button 2* to force disconnect



# TODO List
* memorize & load through AP mode :
        - urls list
        - ESP name
* solder board
* case
